# Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting using LSTM (PyTorch)

## Project Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to analyze and forecast stock market trends based on historical stock data. The model predicts the next dayâ€™s closing price using past 60 days of stock features (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume). The implementation uses PyTorch for building and training the LSTM model and `yfinance` to download historical stock data.

## Features

- Download and preprocess 5+ years of historical stock data (OHLCV format).
- Scale data using Min-Max normalization.
- Prepare sequential data suitable for LSTM input.
- Build a multi-layer LSTM model in PyTorch.
- Train the model with MSE loss and Adam optimizer.
- Evaluate model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualize actual vs predicted stock prices.
